## Game Description
Does your chat know how to count?

Numerica is a mini-game created to be used on Twitch.  The goal is simple: reach the highest possible score.

- Each time a viewer types a number, the counter will increase. 
- If a viewer types the wrong number, the counter will restart.
- A viewer can't type two consecutive numbers.

Good luck!
